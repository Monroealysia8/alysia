 **Some of the most common web development languages include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL.** While Ruby and PHP are exceedingly popular among entrepreneurs, startups, and [web developers](https://www.brytdesigns.com/about/), the primary languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be enough for you to understand the basics of [web design and development](https://www.brytdesigns.com/long-beach-web-design/).
 Each of these web development languages has a **_different purpose_**. For instance, **Ruby** is a scalable and fast programming language that can help you build an extensive website or program in just a short period of time. When paired with the [Ruby on Rails framework](https://www.brytdesigns.com/ruby-on-rails-what-is-it-used-for/), this language gives developers practically everything they need to build a website. With a language like SQL, developers can maintain and optimize large databases in a much more streamlined manner.
 
 ### What Can You Do With HTML?

The main reason why it’s important to know HTML is because **it allows you as a website owner to create the basic structure of you website**, from which you can use any other coding language to enhance the design.


**NOTES ABOUT IMAGE RESOLUTION AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE SPEED OF YOU WEBSITE.***
A JPEG (pronounced “jay-peg”) uses a mathematical algorithm to compress the image and will distort the original slightly. The lower the compression, the higher the file size, but the clearer the image.

**JPEGs are typically used for images such as photographs.**

A GIF (pronounced “jif”) can have no more than 256 colors, but they maintain the colors of the original image. The lower the number of colors you have in the image, the lower the file size will be. GIFs also allow any pixel in the image to be transparent.

**GIFs are typically used for images with solid colors, such as icons or logos.**

A PNG (pronounced “ping”) replicates colors, much like a GIF, but allows 16 million colors as well as alpha transparency (that is, an area could be 50% transparent).

**PNGs are typically used for versatile images in more complex designs BUT they are not fully supported by some older browsers.**

The web is forever getting faster and faster but you obviously want your web pages to download as quickly as possible. Using super-high resolution images isn’t doing your or your user’s bandwidth (or patience) any favors. Image compression is a great tool and you need to strike a balance between image quality and image size. Most modern image manipulation programs allow you to compress images and the best way to figure out what is best suited for yourself is trial and error.



**Notes:** External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.
**2. Relative URL** - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

**Tip:** It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
