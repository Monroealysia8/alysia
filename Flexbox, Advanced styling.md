you can click fork....create a copy of it that is linked to the original or you can clone it.
if you push it back it will say here are some changes that looks better and then could send a push request to push it to it to add notes to his page.

-*ONLY USE EXTERNAL STYLING FROM NOW ON FOR ASSIGNMENTS*

-NO BOOTSTRAP!!! LEARNING TAILWIND FOR THIS LEVEL



-NAV bars can also go above the header.
(if your header is getting too full with content)

**YOU MUST PUT DISPLAY:FLEX FOR THESE TO WORK!!**

**YOU CAN ADD IT TO P, SPAN, DIV, ETC (wouldnt work on img)

Demonstration of adding Flexbox to body:
Main axis: HORIZONTAL
![[Pasted image 20250212183803.png]]

**FLEX BOX:
**JUSTIFY CONTENT: SPACE BETWEEN**
![[Pasted image 20250212183900.png]]

**SPACE AROUND**
(does something similiar to space between)

**FLEX DIRECTION: ROW**

**FLEX WRAP**
-spills down to the next line

**flex-direction: row**
![[Pasted image 20250212184412.png]]

**FLEX DIRECTION:COLUMN**
-THE MAIN AXIS-VERTICAL
![[Pasted image 20250212184905.png]]

**SPACE BETWEEN**
*can make your website look really nice having space on your webpage

FUNDAMENTAL TO FLEXBOX: the main axis changes which means other properties changes when its applied.

**GRID**
GAP: FLEX
(when you use grid you have to use flexbox)
![[Pasted image 20250212185309.png]]

(he uses gap alot...esp when using nav bar)

Example in Nav bar with GAP:

-list style: none     -removes bullets


-you can nest flex items inside of a nest item and so on to make layouts

**CROSS-AXIS**
-HORIZONTAL 
(HANDLES ALIGN ELEMENTS AND ALIGN SELF)
-he uses it a lot LABELS
![[Pasted image 20250212191758.png]]

**ALIGN SELF: are going to move anything with a width and if its written on.

**TEXT-ALIGN-should only be used in a paragraph.

**how to get a reset*
google.com

create a reset.css
copy into that
https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/

![[Pasted image 20250212200548.png]]
add this into your reset. ask chatgt to explaing why we do this rem to make math easier

link your reset at the TOP of the head. bc it reads from top to bottom and will allow the styles i add afterwards. 

(and then use rems instead of px for the webpage. 
2 rem will equal 20 px ....bc of the math we did in the css)

(***YOU WILL COPY AND PASTE THIS INTO PROJECTS INTO THE FUTURE)
AS YOUR CREATE MORE RESETS YOU CAN ADD IT TO THIS PAGE AND CLONE IT DOWN FOR THE REPO
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MAIN
PADDING: 1 REM

(MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOUR WANT TO ADD TO YOUR RESET IF YOU ALWAYS DO THAT TO YOUR MAIN)

-How to move image![[Pasted image 20250212201537.png]]
align:self (works directly on the child)
align-center(works on the whole flex)

SASS-
new syntax for css using a for loop

![[Pasted image 20250212202644.png]]

you can shrink your main with viewwidth.
do a mediaquery for smaller screens
![[Pasted image 20250212202741.png]]

margin-auto..this only works if its not already going across the entire screen
