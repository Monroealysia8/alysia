November 22 Notes.

open a README.md file
instead of a ! for boilerplate, type # and tab for notes to appear
below put ## for level 1
###
h2 or level 2

####
h3 level3

#####
h4 level4

#####
h5 level5

######
h6 level6

(these have to be put in order)
use h1, h2, and then if you need it you can use then h3 chances are there are rarely h4 and even rarer for h5.

i tink you can type i over other content on webpages or em for emphasis for italic

so anything that is written inside of each of these headings is nested inside of the heading tags to organize the content on websites. 
The structure is called a semantic container:
for an example you can use the article tag and nest even a section inside of an article. 
article though is used only for articles like writing a blog or having a lot of content from an article. it contains information so we know that the info in it all pertains to the article.

going back to markdowns: after your ##
you want to put some content in there. when you are done with a space put two spaces when you are done or wanting a list for multiple line click two spaces and the text will jump to another line below. if you dont hit two spaces it will stay on the same line. it basically does a br tag.

for a breakdown 
press minus sign
-item 1
-item 2 and can nest it by tabbing over then typing - sub item 1
and bullet points will appear on the webpage. 

markdown does support some html for img
do the normal img link to add an image if making a template webpage. you can even use the html attributes of width height with px
type to put an image
!

add an imagine. []{}
##anchor tags
[google]{https://google.com}

- [x} type something
- thats how to make a checkbox in obsidain

markdown is useful bc you might find yourself using nothing but markdown for several months at a new company just writing documentation until you get to know the companies way of doing.
