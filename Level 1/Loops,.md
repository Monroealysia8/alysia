December 11th Notes


***For loops***
![[Pasted image 20241211195313.png]]

to use the i(means index)

a different example using i in actual code:

if you needed to use list you use the for loop. 
![[Pasted image 20241211195421.png]]
its pseudo:
![[Pasted image 20241211195802.png]]

***while Loops***
(gives you a bit more flexiblity)
 it will repeat a problem until it finishes.)


***Do-while Loops**
not seen or used that often

***Function***
when you make it do actions
![[Pasted image 20241211183927.png]]

***Recursion***
when you have a function call itself....(you could make it into a loop...but its not really a loop)
![[Pasted image 20241211183953.png]]
when you add step 5 it makes it a recursion...to make it loop...because it has a function that is calling its self


*Example of basic counting loop*
using a ***while loop***:
( it will repeat a problem until it finishes.)
when you think of true or false for a condition you need to also think yes or no. "is the count at 10?" or under 10?![[Pasted image 20241211184830.png]]

you use this...if there are a certain amount of items on a page or to delay something.

another condition: 
like a banking app or login for sales page requiring you put in a pin number and cant have access until the correct pin number is entered by user.

or add another node but not necessary![[Pasted image 20241211185554.png]]
you add another node...saying if count id greater than 3 then send user to reset password etc.

(when you press enter in the browser it will execute code so you might not have to indent in the browser or you can press shift enter if it wont run)
![[Pasted image 20241211185959.png]]
or add text
![[Pasted image 20241211190101.png]]
 ***what makes loop so hard is it repeats usually we think in the linear***

***IS LOGGED IN***
another exmple of while loop to make it guess the pin number![[Pasted image 20241211190351.png]]
always make sure set for your condition to be met example: pin =pin + 1
to stop it can use dev tools or span close on the tab to close it before your browser crashes.!!!!!!!!!

***long li's and long tables are great for loops to help with tendious work.***

***example of it in pseudo:***
![[Pasted image 20241211191157.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241211191213.png]]
and then add the loop:
![[Pasted image 20241211191324.png]]

and you can remove the if bc while loops use a condition.

now and example to see it in real code:
(remember to add a script.js) and add script link at bottom of index.html)
![[Pasted image 20241211191804.png]]

***prompt***
![[Pasted image 20241211191949.png]]
prompt is used in actual code. the input: SET TO part is the prompt part

*HOW TO USE THE   IF*
***creating a log-in condition***
to lock account after three attempts..it could be to alert the user to login on desktop...etc.
![[Pasted image 20241211192408.png]]
you can make up your own verbs if it makes sense like the word BREAK. (HE HAD NEVER USED IT BEFORE IT MADE IT UP)


if they are logged in you add the IF statement to prevent the second display that says welome to the site from running if the account locks bc they cant get the password
![[Pasted image 20241211193239.png]]


BREAK LOOP
is just exiting the loop early


***DO WHILE LOOP
![[Pasted image 20241211193601.png]] 
it stops the loop from running.

EXAMPLE OF HOMEWORK:
![[Pasted image 20241211203305.png]]

IF YOU CAN REDUCE IT DOWN TO TRUE OR FALSE(conditional)QUESTIONS.THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE.

ONCE YOURE DONE WITH ASSIGNMENTS:
you tube javascript basics
review bootstrap.
make little sites for your portfolio.
