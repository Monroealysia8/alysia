then create a link.

control shift r is a refresh command.

you can google css syntax to figure out how to add styling and where to put your semicolons and { }

***check out the css game to learn more/ it was put into the wednesday slack.

with class on css you always use a . then the target
.demo for example

.demo{
margin:auto
(its always set to auto for a rounded border
and width something less than 100)
}

[box shadow]:5px 5 px  10 px black( to give something a shadow)
mdm has a box-shadow generator that you can play with.


***check your user agent style tools in dev tools if something isnt styling right. bc div is already set at default.

***how to make images horizontal with styling.
h1 example h1
main
section 
h2 
h2
section

section
section

section
section

and on style sheet write main {
display:flex;
}

or .d-flex{
display:flex;
}

then link to css with link href.

then to make it smaller on styling sheet. 
section{
width:300px;
}
 only on the main you can add gap:20px;
 or justify -content: space-around;
the gap is only applied when there is room to apply it. you can collapse the dev tools to see how much room you actually have to work for.
