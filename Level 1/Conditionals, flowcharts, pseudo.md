December 10th Notes

*Conditionals*:

***always use three ===
-three === means it is stricly equal to
-a single = means to assign a value
- == means losely equal to.
(this is a deprecated approach)

!= or !<  means NOT
you can even write
NOT===
(anytime you see an ! it means its not)


*Nesting*:
![[Pasted image 20241210185330.png]]



boolean= means true or false

<> greater than/less than
<= and >= greater/lesser than or equal to
<= and >= specifically
(it is considered strictly equal to with only one = because you can only use numbers with > or < ) so it is always stricly

indenting is not required but if you dont use it you will need to include things like ENDIF. (think of it like a closing tag)
ENDIF isnt required either. if it confuses you dont use it


*truthy and falsey*:
means its loosely true or false
- javascript was built in 7 days. they will say dont use the stuff they used back then..use the new rules it what they will say
- you can use truthy falsy to test things but its not used today anymore. the == equals signs. Never put it in your real code. MDM or google can help you. for example: is a an empty link truthy and falsey? and it will tell you if you would rather google it instead of just testing it. 


*multiple-conditions*:
![[Pasted image 20241210191250.png]]
else if is way to check your code.

ELSE is the default.

Python- is for backend coding. its easy to read but it works the same way at javas cript. its harder to do stuff with it. 

*another way is switch it used much but you may see it. it is java script syntax and used in other programs so you may see it*
it solves the exact same problem but it shortens your syntax. 
switch:
![[Pasted image 20241210192126.png]]
you can also add if like in the example if you want to when you use the switch in your pseudo.

-on flowcharts you dont have to add the psudo code like on the previous examples from yesterday. but you could add comments to the pseudo/![[Pasted image 20241210192533.png]]
(you can remove the set and input from the shapes)
![[Pasted image 20241210192544.png]]
but add comments to your pseduo like in this example

*code comment*
in script.js
control forward slash. which will give you # in gray for comments this is in python also
// means the exact same thing. for a code comment in java script.( either can be used to make a comment)

(set and display words are a way to communicate with back end developers so they understand what your data is that you are sending them.
if they have never studied javascript you want to write psuedo so they can understand you bc they may have never studied java)

(managers may send you pseudo and say we need you to code it or for presentations or with stakeholders who have no coding background to explain to them what you will code for them)


*more notes on flowchart*-
 be careful about your ands and or.![[Pasted image 20241210195444.png]]

-make sure you have arrows for each of your outputs.
-he always puts his END shape far away with a long arrow. 

-you only create two arrows off a conditional bc its either true or false![[Pasted image 20241210195830.png]]
-make sure your arrows say true or false on the gray arrows on your conditionals

notejs/notes with git hub or next.js
shows programmers ideas with flowcharts or visuals to get their pull request approved. so they can contribute and to change code on java script etc. 

in interviews: you write out your pseudo code then pull out your flowchart telling them this proves my code works right here.

home work-LAB 1 PROBLEM SOLVING

or get the two sides l and w
add them by two

or multple L times 2
and multiple w times then add them both together

same thing with the area. 

the third question
create psudo and flowchart.
display fail or pass

the second homework lab for week
put in the IF
if the temp
display wear light color
if the temp is 
display wear warm clothing.
then build flow chart like todays example in class.
just an idea to go off of![[Pasted image 20241210202922.png]]
then start your psedo this way:![[Pasted image 20241210203009.png]]
