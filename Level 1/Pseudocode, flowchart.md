December 9th Notes. Monday

website FIGMA is a website you can draw on. 
FIGJAM

pseudocode is a way to communicate with other programers or if someone wants to hire a developer(a stakeholder) to create an application/website but they dont know how to write code they will write out pseudocode or what they want you to code. 
*some engineers will hate the flowchart or pseudo*
*its good for interiews to show where the flow is a visual to give as much data as possible
the chart shows data and the flow more so than pseudo bc it shows where the sanitization part in all the code you have ends*


an example of algorithums.

Reason for using pseudo code
![[Pasted image 20241209185417.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241209190054.png]]

KEEP IT CONSISTENT.(whatever wording you start with continue with that)

USE BACK TIKS. (it helps with python) and curly brackets to show where your variables go.
(this is valid pseudocode)

the console: is where we put live code in. its real java script.
click inspect then next to the elements tab is the console tab where you write java script. 
***you will use visual studio code to actually write your java script though. but console it a good place to test things or debug. to practice it out. 

this is by the book in computer science to write pseudocode:
how to add to a website where only customers over 18 can buy alcohol:
START A codeblock then add START AND END.

you may run into this if working for amazon. they ask you build something like this out. 
(high probability the industry may ask you to make something like this for a website)
*** you could create a README.md file to put this in there

hashing: store the hash into our database. never store someones password or pin number straight into data base bc of hackers. 
you would use something like 
their pin number times this and divide.

TIPS FOR WRITING
START WITH SET, CALCUALTE, OR DISPLAY

BREAK DOWN COMPLEX PROBLEMS INTO MULTPLE STEPS.

THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW USER AND CHECKING IT IS DIFFERENT BREAKDOWN OF STEPS.

YOU MAY USE THIS IN TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS. ITS COMMON TO BE ASKED IN A INTERVIEW TO BUILD OLD A PROBLEM IN FIGMA. REPEAT IT BACK TO THE TO VERIFY. THEN WRITE IT DOWN IN THE FIGMA BEFORE YOU BEGIN.
FOR EXAMPLE "FIND THE MIDDLE OF...."
its a great way to get all your thoughts down before you begin. 

after this weeks home work is done study html and java script if you have extra time. 




FLOWCHART-
-you use a shape on figma
-start with a diamond (what he uses) and then end with a diamond. bc you cant fit alot of words.
-he uses diamond for start and end. try to use some kind of consistency. 
-traingle for the set numb1=4(or take out the word set to use a few words as possible)
then another triangle for the other number...unput num2=11
(you can even add users choice to both.) its good to add a value to it though.
and then connect them so the arrows line up.
(the shapes dont do anything they are just a way to communicate)
a legend= is where you put at the bottom what each shape means
ex: diamonds means "this shape means start/stop" triangle= this shape means input. ![[Pasted image 20241209200410.png]]
-(the app doesnt care about the flowchart its just create a plan or guide or set of instructions to write the code=its a flowchart)
-then in javascript you write the code. 
![[Pasted image 20241209200759.png]]

then you write out the flowchart as code:
![[Pasted image 20241209201018.png]]
and you can add code comments in the code to help explain and add script (always at the bottom)

How do i get to the drawing board=
go to figma
then look for new jamboard
click it on plus sign at bottom and type code in search bar. and pick which one you like in case you ever need it in an interview you have access to it. then click it to plain language. or which ever one you like best. differnet ones change the colors of what is written. he said bash is nice too. and then pick the shapes you like. you can manually do the arrows or click on the next shape to add arrow. 

*another website is Miro*
its another popular one with developers to create a flowchart.
- you can pick which one you prefer and stick with it. 

alternatives in case one sight is down if one company says they use a specific one. and to collaborate 

*Invision is another website that does the same thing*
he uses a blank one this website and then add your shapes etc.

*Microsoft paint is another one*

its really easy to paste your flowcharts into a README.md file with your website to submit.

**there is also ULM you can use like flowchart-will learn this later on in class


raw javascript code in vs code from the psuedocode and flowchart.![[Pasted image 20241209204518.png]]
(not for this weeks class)



LEWIS'S ADVICE:
STUDY YOUR JAVASCRIPT!!!! AND YOU MAY NEED TUTORING FOR THIS EVEN IF YOU HAVENT NEEDED IT BEFORE. MAKE SURE YOU DONT MISS ANY DAYS AFTER THIS WEEK!!!!!
THERE WILL BE LOTS OF STUDYING INVOLVED. YOU WILL NEED TO DO LOTS OF CODING OUTSIDE OF CLASS TO PRACTISE.


***ACTION WORDS:

INPUT 
OR SET

CONDITIONAL OR
FLOW LOGIC

IF

SET

START
OR BEGIN

END
OR FINISH

TO OR =

OUTPUT 
OR DISPLAY 
OR LOG 
OR ALERT



all ways to solve the homework p=2(w+l). there are a lot of ways to solve the same project. there is not set way
