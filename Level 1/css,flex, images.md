creating a link
after typing link and tab scroll to link.css so style.css will automatically show up.
(tip enter font family at top of style sheet to make sure its linked and then can change it from there if you want)

[classes]
 .d-flex{
 } on css
on index.html
go to main and type main class="d-flex">
parent class of flex...then all the children will be horizontal.
