Matrix: 
its a list of a list
it is a table that is structured like a grid. It doesn't look anything like a table in code though.
*a hard concept to learn...will take a lot of practice*
example of a matrix:
for 4 lists for cities and and each city has 4 lists of data.

now, how do we navigate this in code...to read it problematically.
Example of it in code:
![[Pasted image 20241214150252.png]]
-you nest the first list inside of outward brackets which make it a matrix. 
In java script only. a list is an array. 
array === list
and any list or array in java script is ALWAYS going to start with 0.


*navigate lists*
with the for loop.
use a.i. by typing for and tab for options to use with for. you can choose i for index. 
![[Pasted image 20241214150459.png]]
change out array with mylist and alert the element
![[Pasted image 20241214150553.png]]
and then add some html
doctype etc and always add script at the bottom> script then tab src for the script>
i index always start with 0.

***2D arrays***
we will navigate these with a loop (for or while)

to call your inner for loop with j![[Pasted image 20241214153640.png]]
then change array to my list twice and add i next to the j. 

(this technically isnt efficient to put a loop inside a loop bc it takes time. its not scalable. you cant use it for a million users....but this could be something that is asked in an interview)

-you would use this matrix if you needed a running total to add up dynamically.![[Pasted image 20241214154327.png]]

you can also add up columns...

pseudo-code for this....

EXTRA HOMEWORK TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF!!!
*** try rebuilding the slow chart on your own. how would you build this out. just to get the logic down. beyond that you just memorize syntax if you get the logic.
