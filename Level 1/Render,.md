card element using bootstrap. injecting it into 
![[Pasted image 20250109185130.png]]
you can use []
you can even use it to add variables.![[Pasted image 20250109185247.png]]

.push
![[Pasted image 20250109190445.png]]
use this for eblog etc
![[Pasted image 20250109191009.png]]
you can use this or the += to do the same thing. that is called the long hand syntax.
![[Pasted image 20250109191050.png]]

to add another person you will need to create a function if you are adding it after the for loop where everything it already inserting in html

![[Pasted image 20250109191519.png]]
change to this
![[Pasted image 20250109191610.png]]
we will need to make a pure function:

in the function you erase the inner html
![[Pasted image 20250109192032.png]]
why do we need functions? bc whatever array i pass in is which one will render on the page. 
-its good bc if i had different products and needed to change them out you can do that with a function.







Homework lab:

use render function on lab 2:
![[Pasted image 20250109195708.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250109195730.png]]

put it in a function:
![[Pasted image 20250109195840.png]]
you dont want to use the array name to keep it dynamic to use any data your want. and can insert it ![[Pasted image 20250109195944.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250109200001.png]]
then call it

-the second task for homework
you can either remove the first elemt from the array but the index is 0. our function is looking for an array you can instead pass an empty array![[Pasted image 20250109200135.png]]
or you can write it as a varaible/ it needs to be an array with square brackets
![[Pasted image 20250109200158.png]]![[Pasted image 20250109200210.png]]
or you can do this way....
![[Pasted image 20250109200234.png]]
it all does the same thing. but longer


homework task to add 5 more post;
use push
copy the propoeties from object at op
![[Pasted image 20250109200543.png]]
orrr
you can add it into the curly brackets 
![[Pasted image 20250109200624.png]]
then call it
![[Pasted image 20250109200735.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250109200752.png]]
he created a new array fivemore.push and let fivemore = 5

then at bottom you call it. with the fivemore

Lab2 Homework:
dont use render functions for this one.  and it will need several html files. of restarants. it will also need a nav bar. 
have  a link called bands, restaurnts, and 
and then rename to match and wire up your href for each one. 
make sure you update boilerplate stuff instead of navbar. you will want it to go to index etc. (it doesnt say it in instructions but you need to make a link for index otherwise you wont have a home page. you can use the homework assignment for the content you put in with h2 h3 etc.) you can muliple javascript pages render.js app.js to prevent conflicting id's.

CAPSTONE:
this will be used a portfolio. be preapred to answer questions about the code im using. make sure i dont go past what i know bc i will need to explain what  i know.
