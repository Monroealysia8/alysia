Jan 6th Notes

Leet code. 
has questions (daily questions)and shows which companies might use the questions listed for interviews. 
Codewars.
can be set to fundamentals. so the questions are easy. 

Arrays-
brackets and comma spacing
you can go to mdm and type array to see all kinds
or check the array prototype on dev tools

Array.push-
push adds an item to the last index of the array

Array.pop-
add no paramenters ()
it removes an element from the array. 

(impossible to remember all of the arrays. You will need to refresh your memory and study  documentation as you work)



-How to loop through array & putting it to the DOM. 

FOR
has several types of for
after typing for press tab
for   loops in this example
*you need to memorize this syntax. in interviews they will ask you to explain for loops*
3 parts of a for loop
for (){}  is a codeblock
1. variable declaration (let i = 0;
2. a condition that must be met  i < fruits.length;
3. and incremention i++
     { console.log}

***PRACTISE THIS! PRACTISE THIS! PRACTISE THIS!!!!!!! MEMORIZE WITHOUT TOOLS!!!!!!! SUPER IMPORTANT***


-How to iterate over an array.
.foreach()
this is a built in method but it requires a function to be called on every item of the array
press. and for each will pull up
myMovieList.foreach


=> 
An arrow function or also called annoymous function or lamb function
it will call on every function i make.
the syntax..

or you can add curley brackets and add more code
![[Pasted image 20250108004348.png]]
if you are only doing one thing you dont need the curley brackets

this item or parameter here is called the iterator![[Pasted image 20250108004456.png]]
meaning it is the element within the array

the .foreach is Lewis's preferred way to iterate over an array. **Iterate**: When you iterate over an array, you move through the array, accessing each element in order. This is typically done using loops like `for`, `while`, or other looping constructs depending on the language you're using.

- an alternative for iterating over an array

-Render means  
to put it to the DOM. into html
% symbol will be used for the lab to find the even numbers.![[Pasted image 20250108011130.png]]
