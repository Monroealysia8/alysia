December 18th Notes

argument:
a value, data type, or string that you are passing to
repeating a block of code by using console.log
this access to your developer tools only
![[Pasted image 20241218183723.png]]

another function-
document.write
it accesses your elements string....*this one outputs it to the page (document or dom)


-How to insert code to your page without document.write

you can use any DIV or any element that has an id. 
to insert your code or inject your html into your script

 ![[Pasted image 20241218184147.png]]
 on script page enter this to link to html
 ![[Pasted image 20241218184250.png]]

id's MUST BE a STRING
![[Pasted image 20241218184641.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241218184845.png]]
DIV OR SECTION ETC WORKS

-STEPS TO INSERT CODE INTO YOUR HTML...
ONCE YOU HAVE AN ID ON ANY ELEMNET..(ANY ELEMENT YOU WANT TO CHANGE. YOU GO TO YOUR JAVASCRIPT. THEN USE THIS SYNTAX![[Pasted image 20241218185209.png]]

(you can name your variable name anything you want just make sure it matches your id you made up)
always use lower case for functions. the only one that can be uppercase is Number & Math

*dont put p inside an h1*
![[Pasted image 20241218190104.png]]
to add to the h1 is called innerHTML
to add the emphasis.

HTMLinnertext-
would be used for things like facebook where the user puts things on a wall. 

Dummy file-
test.html to help write html


use back tick quotes instead of quotes to paste multiple lines of html in script. 
-back tiks are also good for canctenation. you can also use dollar signs
![[Pasted image 20241218190836.png]]
 an example of the same line of code in concatenation![[Pasted image 20241218190915.png]]
(you can use either you like)


if you need to update the html bc a user logged in you would need to inject html into java by using id to create a dynamic webpage.



-More on functions
you can create your own function 
they always have () after it. 

a function designed to do a addition:
![[Pasted image 20241218191207.png]]
then add curly brackets...
inside the paraenthese you add parameters: which are num1banana, num2banana
![[Pasted image 20241218191300.png]]
inside of the curleybrackets you can do something to the parementers....like console.log
![[Pasted image 20241218191452.png]]

the function is being declared by the two parameters.

(you would create functions to find the parameters of a room for a real estate company)
![[Pasted image 20241218191833.png]]

then you call the function:
![[Pasted image 20241218191916.png]]

function declaration-calling the functions by using parameters in the () as many times as you want.![[Pasted image 20241218192052.png]]
*here it is called a parameter but down below it is called arguments*
function invocation- think of magic...invoking the funtion

*then when you call the function at the bottom we call them arguments*

console.logging the info is pointless bc the only person who can read this is the developer. so instead of console.log we return it. ![[Pasted image 20241218192351.png]]

Return- means we can not return to it.  its terminated. 
we use this in place of console.log





html can not go in javascript without being inside of an element and '' 
![[Pasted image 20241218192928.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241218193026.png]]
and you must use one of these three


-another function
in footer
add id
then![[Pasted image 20241218193230.png]]

+= adds numbers to it





step 1 of creating a function
![[Pasted image 20241218194809.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241218195105.png]]
how to inset it directly into html
![[Pasted image 20241218195227.png]]
then call your function
![[Pasted image 20241218195535.png]]
 if you add two calls
  you can make them both run by adding
  a plus before your equals sign![[Pasted image 20241218195717.png]]
to show mutlipe lines







-another function with logic
![[Pasted image 20241218200305.png]]





Objects-
is a key value pair`
![[Pasted image 20241218201635.png]]
we use these to make it simpler and easier to access on dev tools.

this is how the same information looks without objects( probably not a good idea to do it this way)
![[Pasted image 20241218201448.png]]

another object ---called object literal
objects-describing code as if they are actual objects. 
example "close the pen" "open the pen"
![[Pasted image 20241218202405.png]]
 you can group entire blocks of code into this. it is really desired in the industry. you can use it to create a game
 
 
 css uses object pairs too except css uses ; and javascript uses ,
![[Pasted image 20241218202522.png]]



***const*** shows the developer that that value will never be overridden.
overridden-
let means that it can be changed, you cant reassign the const variable.



lab1 problem 3 in speduo code
![[Pasted image 20241218203625.png]]

TO DO FROM LEWIS!!!
*** try rewatching the class. speed it up to code with him
study while on break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 weeks to catch up and watch these videos. or redo the original labs, watch youtube videos.
