tolowercase- makes it lower case
*numbers have functions*

Conditionals:
write the word if then ()
inside write your conditional logic.
after parenthis put {}
*the code inside the () is where the conditional* info goes. inside the {} is where the info that is displayed goes in.

***you use if***
***with boolean logic***

how to convert it into a number

use the Number to convert  a string into a number

 alot of developers done know this  so you could just add Number to the front of your string. 

=== strictly equal
!= called bang operator- it means not

using conditional logic-
![[Pasted image 20241217190947.png]]
if its else if the SECOND one wont run 
you want both to execute.... use just IF to run both*
*BY USING ELSE IF YOU ARE TIEING IT TOGETHER INTO A CONDITIONAL CODE*

![[Pasted image 20241217192223.png]]

you could use your else in this way to prevent the user by breaking your site if they were to enter a word if you were asking for a number
