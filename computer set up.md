[computer set up]
get hub code spaces is another notes app
Microsoft edge is alternative to google chrome but he uses google chrome so that is best

THE ELEMENTS TAB
for HtMl 
tools on google chrome

VISUAL STUDIO CODE TO DOWNLOAD
type vs code on google
its an IDE - a place to type things or text editer
on the select additional tasks click add open with code tabs, click add it to path also all must be checked 4
you can add it to your desktop of you want
(it might be in your downloaded folders) if its already installed
it is important to open a vs code in the folder you are creating.
make sure you create a projects folder in documents or desktop etc. to contain all your folders. you can name it whatever you want
in that folder create a new folder inside that one
have a folder for GitHub as yours projects folders for all your repositories-for the projects due now-in lowercase name it html-lab (no spaces and all lower case)
once in right click and click open with code or you can go to vs code and click open
(make sure you only have one folder at a time)
*(if you need to have 2 projects open then open them in vs code not the folder)
***chrome os will need lynix to use vs code

code spaces
if on chrome book and cant use vs code you will have to use code spaces

how to use code spaces:
open GitHub
think of GitHub as a projects folder
you can go in on GitHub to create other folders inside of your projects folders or repository
how to create a new repository -a drop down on the right
click new
name it
click the "add to Readme file"
if you click this is will skip the next step
if you forget to check it then click read me on the next page and then commit to changes and confirm again
then click the tab "code" to get to the home of the project

you can also click uploading an existing file
GitHub is a good way to work with other coders to work on the project at the same time. its a place to upload your projects and then submit them.
GitHub skips alot of steps when uploading files. you wont have to zip it etc. you can use GitHub if you done have access to vs code
GitHub is the standard for developers!!! but it can be slow so thats why we use vs code

example: create a repository called lab 1 and then lab 2 etc

HOW TO USE CODE SPACES:
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FILE CREATED IN GITHUB TO GET TO THE PAGE YOU NEED ON TO CODE SPACES..THE README HAS TO BE CLICKED OTHERWISE THERE IS NO FILE TO OPEN. IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT IT IS BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
READ ME file is how other developers can contribute to your code...it isn't something that will be actually used at the beginning of class
we are only using it to get a file that has something in it
steps to follow to get into code spaces....
click code tab
then click green button saying code then click code spaces tab. it allows you access vs code on yuour browser

THE WORKFLOW FOR CREATING new projects (websites)
create new folder
name it 
right click show more options...open with code

INSTALL SOME EXTENSIONS;
click GitHub theme on the left for vs code....this works for code spaces too. use GitHub dark

***and ***INSTALL LIVE SERVER;
USE TO PREVIEW WEBSITES THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON. YOU ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP WEBSITES AS IF THEY WERE ON THE INTERNET
IF LIVE PREVIEW DOESNT WORK YOU CAN USE LIVE SERVER(five server) AND SEND MESSAGE IF HAVING ISSUES INTALLING THIS 
*****to test if it working click new file under your folder on the computer that you already created. create an html file called index.html (index means home page)
you will always have an index. html for servers to find your home page.
once you have the file created you will use boilerplate. 
shift 1 to put in an exclamation point which will let you see  drop down ( if it doesn't work your html is wrong)
you should see a tab called "emmet abbreviate" and once you click it it will show boilerplate template
you can type content like the text "hello" and should see "go live" on the bottom. if you dont then try the other installation of live server. if it doesn't work uninstall and install another one. seek help if this doesn't work to schedule a one on one.

SETTINGS THAT ARE IDEAL FOR VS CODE. 
the white dot by the file name means it is not saved
in vs code click file to enable auto save.

ANOTHER EXTENSION to add:
prettier-is a code formatter
click code formatter and then click the prettier

once prettier is installed
IN SETTINGS; BOTTOM LEFT CORNER LOOKS LIKE A GEAR WHEELS AND GO TO SETTTINGS
click text editor then click formatting
check top two boxes...format on paste and format on save

in settings again...
type in wrap...word wrap shows up
click on

FOR WINDOWS ONLY***** change 3 three things (make sure left box is unchecked for only show new options)
IF CHROME OR MAC YOU MAY NEED TO DO AN UPDATE
UNDER SOURCE CONTROL
for git (different than GitHub)
you should see initialize compository...if you see this you are great
if you see the install download git for windows then you NEED to install. 
click done and always
 you need a 64 bit machine
then click top right and install in drop box
KEEP CLCIKING NEXT UNTIL
you see choosing the default editer used prompt ..use visual studio code as default...i took a screenshot for example.
next prompt...select the override the default branch name for new repositories. make sure it says main in the text box.
keep clicking next until configuring the terminal emulator to use with git...click windows default console windows. for example i took a screen shot.
after this is installed...

ADDING YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT TO GIT (git bash is a terminal)
google search commands 
configure user name and email
type in google "git config username and email"
copy the commands for username and email..(these are also in the class slack app)
click on explorer or note taking app. create a folder called myfile.txt to edit the commands
copy the command and put my username
copy the other command and put my email
once these are edited in the file
go to start menu type git...and git bash comes up.
paste each command into the git bash terminal(dont press control V) use your mouse and right click
press enter key
then do the same with your name "Alysia Monroe"
(all this is optional at this point...but makes it a lot easier) get help with a ta. you have until the end of level 1 to get it done.
ALL OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE IN SLACK BUT NOT ALL INFO. IS THERE.
