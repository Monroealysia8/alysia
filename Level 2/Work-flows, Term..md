***cool shortcuts***
![[Pasted image 20250208222002.png]]
p.footer then press tab
img.profile-pic   then press tab
(this creates a class if you use the .)

unput#  is another shortcut


**(personal note to self...i dont like this workflow)**
Another workflow....some students prefer this way. 
go to GitHub create a repository.
*you have not created a folder or file in vscode. **
on this one you will click read me!!!!
click the create repository at bottom.
click the green code button. Make sure you are on the local tab not the codespaces.
click copy URL to clipboard
(you wont have to copied code like in the other workflow)
go to local files like you normally would have done and open your gitbash. and clone with right click.
that will open a main branch
then type git code . to open vscode
and then open your terminal as usual and then git add . and
git commit -m "" as normal.

-staging......(its important)
the period means it will commit everything so far
for example if i had a password.

by adding the period you done want to add the . because that will push to github
An alternative would be to do this:
git add index.html rather than git add .

-another way to prevent a file from being added to github.

using the quotations to add multi-line comment.

***control C
means cancel in terminals (kill the operation)***

if ever you realize you are accidently deleting your computer control C will stop it
