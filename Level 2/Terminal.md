February 3 Notes

$cd         makes it go to a different directory
example: $cd hello to pull up the hello file

$cd ..  to go back up two places(two dots)

the dot means where you're at

one dot means the parent folder

$ pwd lets you see what folder your in

$ ls         this shows us what we have in the folder. (it stands for list)

Basic important commands...../

Touch- a special command used to update the modified date
(the way a developer uses touch is to create a file)
$ touch    then type in the filename....
for example:   $ touch script.js
it will create the file in whatever terminal file you are in

this will move you out of a file with the .. and then bring you in another file by typing in the /petwebsite. 

![[Pasted image 20250203201656.png]]
this will bring you into another folder using cd

![[Pasted image 20250203201730.png]]
you can create multiple files at once like this... its faster but keep in mind there is nothing in them. make sure to put a space after each file name and then add your boilerplate to each file so it has content in them. 

$mkdir    it makes a directory....when speaking with people in IT you must call folders directories

and then it adds it to the styles folder



Bonus commands...not required to know..c

$ mv   will move something
![[Pasted image 20250203202245.png]]
it it showing what you are moving and where you are moving it to. including the file name
(the first line was him making the folder(directory)
(then the next line was him moving it to a new place)

you can use MV to a new file to make it a new file like an index.html to a read.me

$ cp
another way to copy

making multiple html files

BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS COMMAND
THE DELETE IT WILL PERMANTLY DELTED AND CAN NOT BE RECOVERED (could potentially wipe your entire computer)
$ rm          means remove
![[Pasted image 20250203202659.png]]


he will typically not delete things in the terminal but the normal way to prevent unwanted information from deleted. there is a time and a place to use it...but only use it when you want it gone FOREVER.
